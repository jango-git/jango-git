# Hey, I'm Jango 👋

I build small things that (hopefully) make other things easier.

Mostly working with **Three.js**, **TypeScript**, for 3D on the web — especially for short interactive mobile experiences.

## Here's some stuff I tinker with:

- 🐭 **[animouse](https://github.com/jango-git/animouse)** – animation state machine for Three.js
- 🎯 **[eventail](https://github.com/jango-git/eventail)** – lightweight event dispatcher with priorities
- 📱 **[laymur](https://github.com/jango-git/laymur)** – lightweight Three.js UI toolkit mainly for mobile ads (early stage)
- 🧩 **[three-zoo](https://github.com/jango-git/three-zoo)** – just some small 3D components I reuse

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk graphics, animations, or just share ideas!
